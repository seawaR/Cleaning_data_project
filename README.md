# Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project

This repository contains the files needed to complete the project for the **Getting and Cleaning Data** course.

# Files

- `run_analysis.R`: this script contains the code needed to download the data, transform the datasets and save the new tidy dataset.
- `measures_averages.txt`: this file contains the final tidy dataset.
- `CodeBook.md`: This file contains the code book for understanding what is available in the tidy dataset and a brief explanation of the steps followed in the script.

*Please note that the raw data (zip file or uncompressed) is not included as it is not necessary because the script already downloads the data for the exercise.*
